1. Developed and compared models to forecast hourly electricity load and prices using over nine years of real-world German
market data, spanning linear methods (AR, OLS) and machine learning algorithms (Random Forests, Regression Trees).
2. Applied feature engineering, time series decomposition, and rolling-window estimation for dynamic model updates,
improving predictive accuracy.
3. Evaluated model performance using out-of-sample MSFE and Diebold-Mariano tests, and interpreted machine learning
predictions through variable importance analysis to identify key market drivers.
